This repos contains code snippets used in the webinar

The code snippets are provided as examples only... if you run them, then it is at your own risk - they are provided without support or warranty. Note that the scripts will create services within IBM Cloud, that will attract costs, which you will be liable for. 

The terra2 directory provides example terraform code.
The vpc-scripts directory provides example shell scripts, using ibmcloud CLI commands to build VPC infrastructure.
