This repos contains code used in the webinar

The code is provided as examples only... if you run them, then it is at your own risk - they are provided without support or warranty. Note that the scripts will create services within IBM Cloud, that will attract costs, which you will be liable for. You will typically need an api key and a paid account to run them successfully. 

The terra2 directory provides example terraform code.


The vpc-api directory provides an example python program that will retrieve details of any VPC you currently have in the region you are connected to and another program that will create a VPC.... or at least the start of one!


The vpc-scripts directory provides a set of example shell scripts that will create a VPC with the name of your choosing and a number of VSIs in the VPC that you select, using the ibmcloud CLI.
